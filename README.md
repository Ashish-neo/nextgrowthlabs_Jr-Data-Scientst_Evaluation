**Part 2:**

1.Write about any difficult problem that you solved. (According to us difficult - is something which 90% of people would have only 10% probability in getting a similarly good solution). 
>Ans:- In my major project when i try to detect number from number using pytesseract it give us worng result from actual number.So,then i do lot's of noise reducation technique onto that image but it's gives same result again and again and my project supervisor alos don't kmow the worng with tha Image and then i going to try another model like easyocr but it runs on gpu but in my laptop i don't have any gpu.so i run easyocr on cpu and do sone filtering on it and it gives better result compare to the pysteeseract.And when we rum the model on gpu of our colage it gives exact result we are accepting . some time try other models always good for the project.


2.Formally, a vector space V' is a subspace of a vector space V if
V' is a vector space
every element of V′ is also an element of V.
Note that ordered pairs of real numbers (a,b) a,b∈R form a vector space V. Which of the following is a subspace of V?
The set of pairs (a, a + 1) for all real a
The set of pairs (a, b) for all real a ≥ b
The set of pairs (a, 2a) for all real a
The set of pairs (a, b) for all non-negative real a,b

>Ans:-this set of pairs (a,b) for all real a >= b
